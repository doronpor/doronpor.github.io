Principal Engineer driven by a deep curiosity for how machines perceive the world.  
My work sits at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning** and **Autonomous Vehicle**  

I currently focus on **3D perception** and **end-to-end autonomous driving research**, where I design architectures that bridge the gap between **research innovation** and **real-world production**.  

This website is also home to my [blog](/blog), where I write about **AI research**, **computer vision trends**, and **technical deep dives** â€” from perception to end-to-end autonomous driving.
